### 1.INTRODUCE

#### 1.1.MOTIVATION

As we know, sensor and actuator are basic parts of an IoT system.In fact, the IoT system consists of complex devices. Each device is a collection of many sensors and actuators (e.g. light, air conditioning,...)

With different devices, the set of sensors and actuators are different from other collection about set of components (just including sensors, just including actuators or both) , quantity and  combination of elements in the creation of a real thing. Thus, the management of these devices is cumbersome and required a lot of efforts.

Giving a model of combination of sensors and actuators help to set up emulated IoT devices that become easier and more convenient, providing utilities for IoT developers in the implementation of IoT application.

#### 1.2.OVERVIEW EMULTED THINGS 

Emulated  things provide the model of combination between sensors and actuators in creating an IoT real devices. 

Implementing some common “Emulated Things” (e.g. Smartlight…)

#### 2.2. Data Model

**SmartLight**

### 4.SCOPE AND DEVELOPMENT ORIENTATION 

**Now,** giving the model for emulated things based on generic sensors and actuators.Implementing emulated thing such as Smartlight…

**In future**, TEIT will emulated other common devices such as air conditioning, smartphone, tablet,...
